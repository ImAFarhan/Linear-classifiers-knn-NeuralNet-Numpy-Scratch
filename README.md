This is an implementation of following classifiers in Numpy. I have **implemented the forward and backward pass from scratch without the help of autograd**. To be sure whether my anaytical gradients are correct I have used centeral difference operator to find the relative error betweeen the two. I have also written a cross-validation mechanism for hyperparameter tuning.

* **k-Nearest Neighbor classifier** : The notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.
* **Support Vector Machine** : The notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.
* **Softmax classifier**: The notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.
*  **two-Layer Neural Network**: The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.
*  **Higher Level Representations: Image Features** : The notebook features.ipynb will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.
